# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structure with Testing

> data structure + algorithm = executable program

### What is Big O?
> Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Rules:
- Worst Case
- Remove Constant
- Different terms for inputs
- Drop Non Dominants

### What is good code
- Readabl
- Scalable
    - Speed
    - Memory

**data structure**
- [Array](#Array)
- reverse string
- [Hash Tables](#Hash-Tables)

**algorithm**

## Array
> Array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements.

| Props | Cons |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| fast lookup  | slow insert  |
| fast push/pop  | slow delete  |
| ordered  | fixed size (static array)  |

## Hash-Tables

#### Testing configure
install environment

```yarn```

yarn Test

```yarn test --watch```
